Paper 2010/2011: 
SINGLE IMAGE scaled, patient-specific 3D vertebral model reconstruction
based on 2D lateral fluoroscopy

the reconstruction is based on:
1) only 1 fluoro image --> possible limitations??
2) a training model constisting of a limited number of binary data derived from CT-Scans / AND not a generic vertebrae model

So, potentially if there's a big enough training dataset,
this method can successfully reconstruct with high accuracy (measured against
CT binary data), a 3d vertebra from a single fluoro image


????????? investigate how the 4 following are done so as to be able to replicate  ??????????

Read about landmark-to-ray registration 2d to 3D in:
(Statistically Deformable 2D/3D Registration for Estimating Post-operative Cup Orientation from a Single Standard AP X-ray Radiograph)

Find out if there are other 

a) The landmark-to-ray registration is used to find 
an initial scale and an initial rigid transformation between the
fluoroscopic image and the statistical shape model. 

b) The estimated scale and rigid transformation are then used to initial-
ize the statistical shape model–based 2D/3D reconstruction scheme.

c) The construction of the statistical shape models (from CT real patient data)
  
d) Statistically deformable 2D/3D reconstruction approach

Paper 2015 more or less:
3d-reconstruction-anatomical-structures-2d-x-ray-images: (from 1 or more x-rays)

1) Compare the X-ray in question with a number of virtual x-rays from 
	3d models, examining both shape and intensity information (as the
	virtual x-rays come from a 3d models that 
	incorporate volumetric density information --> Where do we get these from?? is there any better way around it????

2) a training model constisting of a limited number of binary data derived from CT-Scans / AND not a generic vertebrae model HERE AS WELL AS BEFORE 
in ("scaled, patient-specific 3D vertebral model reconstruction based on 2D lateral fluoroscopy"), this time enriched by internal bone intensity information

-Summary: i)we have a 3d model coming from SSMs a priory real patient CT-data to start with...(a mean model of say 30 patients is proven to be able to create a 			reliable starting point)
		  ii) produce virtual x-rays of this 3d model
		  iii) compare the virtual x-rays 3d model contours&intensity information with silhouettes of reference real patient X-ray images

Otherwise previous approaches' Problems identified:
X-ray silhouettes first have to be extracted from the individual patient's X-ray images in a manual or automatic manner (by segmenting the x-ray of hte patient).
and be compared with the SSM model projections contours

!Even more problematic is to use contour information only, as this ignores important information on the interior structures!!.

All the previously mentioned newer methods are based on 3D SSMs which is better than :

Or

to obtain 3D coordinates of anatomical landmarks that need to be identified
in the 2D radiographs using A generic 3D model of a scoliotic patient, reconstructed
from computer tomography (CT), and then this is adapted to these landmarks using free form-
deformation to estimate patient-specific surface models.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Their PDMs are a result of training sets that are created from triangulated surface models of pre segmented CT- scans' binary data exports

The idea is that 3D surface models of the BONE structure in question are extracted from real CT-data of a number of patients 
and feeded as a priori knowedge for the 3D reconstruction ,
The reconstruction is progressively optimized by deforming the SSM model based on a cost function of similarity between the
real X-ray reference and either the SSM model's Virtual X-ray (2015 newer mehtod) or the SSM model's contour projections (2006,2008,2010)

maybe investigate projective tetrahedra alternatives???
