<h1>msm_points: Points file</h1>
<p>All the tools in UoMASM assume that points are provided in text files in one of the two formats shown below.<br>
The <tt>msm_points</tt> class encodes a set of points which can be read from/written to a text file in the format shown below.</p>

This is the default format which is written by the tools and library functions:
<tt><pre>
version: 1
n_points: 4
{
316.069 201.255
410.593 206.549
333.881 320.539
411.389 320.995
}
</pre></tt>

Note that points in a simpler two column format can also be read in:
<tt><pre>
4
316.069 201.255
410.593 206.549
333.881 320.539
411.389 320.995
</pre></tt>
The first line indicates how many points follow.
