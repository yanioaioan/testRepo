<h1>masm: Manchester's Active Shape Model library</h1>
The <tt>masm</tt> library contains classes to implement a 2D Active Shape Model (ASM).<br>
The ASM is an algorithm to match statistical shape models to image - or rather, to find a set of model points on an image with positions constrained by a statistical shape model.<br>
It comes with a set of <a href="masm_tools_overview.html">tools</a> to build ASMs and to run them over sets of images (see the tools directory).<br>

<h3><a name="masm_requirements">Requirements</h3>
The masm library depends on VXL, and in particular <tt>contrib/mul/msm</tt> - the statistical shape modelling library in Manchester's contributions to VXL.

<h2><a name="masm_algorithm">The Basic Algorithm</h2>
Given a shape model instance defining the initial position of a set of model points on an image,
the basic ASM algorithm iterates the following steps:

<ul>
<li> Search around each point with a local model to find the best local position of that point
<li> Optimise the shape and pose parameters to best fit to the new point positions
</ul>

The <tt>masm_model</tt> class contains the data required for an ASM.  In particular:<br>
<ul>
<li>A copy of a statistical shape model (<tt>msm_shape_model</tt>)
<li>A set of <tt>msm_point_finder_model</tt> objects, one for each point.
</ul>

To search an image with an ASM, you must create a <tt>masm_searcher</tt> object, which contains
the current shape and pose parameters, as well as a set of <tt>msm_point_finder</tt> objects, which will do the search for each point.<br>
There can be multiple <tt>masm_searcher</tt> objects, all using the same <tt>masm_model</tt>.

<h3><a name="masm_usage1">Example usage</h3>
To load in a model and use it to search an image:
<tt><pre>
  // Load in the ASM
  masm_model model;
  if (!vsl_quick_file_load(model,params.asm_path)) return 1;

  // Create a searcher (which will be initialised with the default pose)
  masm_searcher asm_searcher(model);

  // Load in an image
  vimt_image_2d_of<vxl_byte> image;
  vimt_load(image,image_path);
  if (image.image().size()==0) return 2;

  // Most models assume grey-scale images.  If RGB then convert to grey.
  if (image.image().nplanes()==3)
  {
    vil_image_view<vxl_byte> grey_image;
    vil_convert_planes_to_grey(image.image(),grey_image);
    image.image()=grey_image;
  }

  // Build an image pyramid from this
  vimt_gaussian_pyramid_builder_2d<vxl_byte> pyr_builder;

  vimt_image_pyramid image_pyr;
  pyr_builder.build(image_pyr,image);

  // Perform the search
  asm_searcher.search(image_pyr);

  // Get the resulting points
  msm_points final_points = asm_searcher.points();
</pre></tt>

<h2><a name="masm_sequence">Sequences of ASMs</h2>
It is often useful to use a sequence of ASMs to get faster and more robust results.<br>
For instance, the first ASM may work at a low resolution with only a few shape parameters - this can get to the approximate solution quickly. Subsequent ASMs will then work at increasing resolution with more shape modes.  This is a generalisation of the original "Multi-Resolution ASM" idea.<br>
This is expressed in the library using the <tt>masm_model_series</tt> class, which stores a sequence of <tt>masm_model</tt> objects, and the associated <tt>masm_series_searcher</tt> which stores a set of <tt>masm_searcher</tt> objects, which will be applied in sequence.<br>
The latter is used in almost exactly the same way as the single ASM:

<tt><pre>
  // Load in the ASM sequence
  masm_model_series model;
  if (!vsl_quick_file_load(model,params.asm_path)) return 1;

  // Create a searcher (which will be initialised with the default pose)
  masm_series_searcher asm_searcher(model);

  // Perform the search
  asm_searcher.search(image_pyr);

  // Get the resulting points
  msm_points final_points = asm_searcher.points();
</pre></tt>
