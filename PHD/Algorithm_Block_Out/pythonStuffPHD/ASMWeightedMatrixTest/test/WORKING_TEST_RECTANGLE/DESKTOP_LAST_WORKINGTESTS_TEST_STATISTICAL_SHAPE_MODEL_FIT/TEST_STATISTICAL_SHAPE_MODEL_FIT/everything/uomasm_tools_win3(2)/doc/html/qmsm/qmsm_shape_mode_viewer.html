</TABLE>
A tool which allows a user to
<ul>
<li>Load in a shape model and an associated set of <a href="msm_curves.html">curves</a>
<li>Animate one of the modes
<li>Save frames for one or several modes (to allow a movie to be created)
</ul>
The shape model is assumed to have been built by <tt>msm_build_shape_model</tt> or equivalent tool.<br>

Usage:
<tt><pre>
qmsm_shape_mode_viewer [-s shape_model.msm] [-c curves.crvs]
</pre></tt>
where <tt>curves.crvs</tt> is a <a href="msm_curves.html">curves</a> file and <tt>shape_model.msm</tt> contains an <tt>msm_shape_model</tt> object (for instance, built by the <tt>msm_build_shape_model</tt> tool.<br>

<h2>Menu Options</h2>
<h3>File Menu</h3>
<ul>
<li>Load Model - Load in a shape model (msm_shape_model)
<li>Load Curves - Load curves from a <a href="msm_curves.html">.crvs</a> file.
<li>Save Frames - Save frames as images for current mode (eg mode_XX.png if basename is "mode")
<li>Save Frames (n modes) - Save frames as images for all modes up to this one (eg mode_s1_XX.png, mode_s2_XX.png etc)
</ul>
<h3>View Menu</h3>
<ul>
<li>Graph Props - Display panel allowing size/colours of points/curves to be tweaked
</ul>

<h3>Other variables</h3>
<ul>

<li>Max.D: Select parameter range as a percentage of the standard deviation for the mode.
</ul>
