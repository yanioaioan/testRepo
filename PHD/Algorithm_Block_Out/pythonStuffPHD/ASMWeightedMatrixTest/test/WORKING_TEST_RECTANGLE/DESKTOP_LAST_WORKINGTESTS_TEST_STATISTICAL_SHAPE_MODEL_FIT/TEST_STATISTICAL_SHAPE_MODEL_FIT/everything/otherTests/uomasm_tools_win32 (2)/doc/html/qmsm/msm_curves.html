<h1>msm_curves: Curves file</h1>
The <tt>msm_curves</tt> class encodes one or more "curves" as a set of point indices.<br>
Each curve is assumed to join the given points in the order supplied.<br>
If the curve is not open, then it is assumed to be closed and the last point is
connected to the first point.<br>
The <tt>crvs</tt> file is a text file defining the curves in a fairly easy to read/edit way.<br>
For example, <tt>face_68pts.crvs</tt> defines the curves on a 68 point face markup:<br>
<tt><pre>
curves: {
  curve:  { name: Chin open: true indices: { 0:14 } } 
  curve:  { name: LEyebrow open: false indices: { 15:20 } } 
  curve:  { name: REyebrow open: false indices: { 21:26 } } 
  curve:  { name: LEye open: false indices: { 27:30 } } 
  curve:  { name: REye open: false indices: { 32:35 } } 
  curve:  { name: Nose open: true indices: { 37:45 } } 
  curve:  { name: Nostrils open: true indices: { 46 47 } } 
  curve:  { name: OuterLips open: false indices: { 48:59 } } 
  curve:  { name: TopLip open: true indices: { 48 60 61 62 54 } } 
  curve:  { name: BottomLip open: true indices: { 54 63 64 65 48 } } 
}
</pre></tt>

The elements of each curve are:
<ul>
<li>name: The following text (which must not include any whitespace) defines a name for the curve
<li>open: true/false  - Defines whether the curve is open or closed
<li>indices: A list of integers defining the points to be connected. Ranges can be specified, such as 0:14 or 45:40 (for counting backwards) to indicate all integers in the given range.
</ul>
