first compute g(mean) of mean shape
Then for each training image-shape from the set of training images-shapes
	  for each landmark of each training image-shape
		Dprevious=100;//an intentionally large value
		for each point along the normal of each landmark
			computer g;
			compute D=(g − gmean)T *Sginverse*(g − gmean)
			if(D<Dprevious)
			{
				//save this point along the normal as the best fit
				bestfitpoint=point
			}
			Dprevious=D
	 	update point based on bestfitpoint
	till convergence
